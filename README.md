### ELDERAAN: A LAUNCHER MOBILE APPLICATION DESIGNED FOR SENIOR CITIZENS

We observe elders around us struggling with their mobile phone and asking for help on simple features. The question that we are aiming to answer is: How can we help seniors adopt new behaviours and face this technical change? How can we make life easier for the geriatric community and really put ourselves in their shoes and try to understand the issues they might be facing. 
We spoke with our grandparents and older neighbours, and what we observed was that the general interface is not very user-friendly for them. We were told that their irritability regarding the phone usage diminished its actual purpose by belittling its advantages. We asked seniors around us if they had heard about any latest devices or conceptions to help overcome this difficulty. No one had. We looked for existing solutions in all areas to see what the market was offering and found some existing solutions which were not very popular among our interviewees. 
That’s why we have decided to create our own solution- Elderaan: A Launcher Mobile Application Designed for Senior Citizens.

Few problems/issues faced by the geriatric community include the following:
- Complicated interface for the mobile device’s main functions.
- Small font and illegible typeface.
- Issues regarding colour and brightness adjustment.
- Having to turn to someone else for assistance.
- Unique problems faced by each user.


There are a lot of design opportunities to help seniors make better use of their mobile phone: 
- Create a simpler interface for the phone’s main functions.
- Propose customized solutions depending on the user’s category. (Beginner/Average/Advanced)
- Adapt the interface to the user’s physical condition.

From our interviews, we realised that we needed to initiate the entire process with a launcher application to get started and then help with the transition for our senior users. All that our senior clients require from us is some basic simplicity and easier accessibility where they would not feel the need to go to another person for assistance. 

The idea for its application is very simple- 
- Our users need to be able to switch on/off the phone.
- They should be able to learn basic gestures.
- Understand how to perform simple tasks like taking a photo, setting an alarm etc.


We wish to provide the best and the easiest experience for our clients, actually understand the issues faced by them and help address and resolve their concerns.
